# CGSS Exam Questions With 100% Correct Answers 2024

**1. What is sanctions evasion?**

_Correct Answer:_

A counterparty is the other side of a transactionâ€”the seller where the customer is the buyer, or vice versa. An institution establishes counterparty relationships with other third-party participants in a transaction for an established customer. Another way to establish a counterparty relationship is to provide a service to an individual or entity that has not established a full customer relationship. Such a relationship usually exists only for the life of the transaction itself.

**2. What are shell companies, and how are they used by sanctions evaders?**

_Correct Answer:_

Shell companies are companies without active business or significant assets. These companies are legal, but sanctions evaders often use them illegitimately, e.g., to disguise business ownership. Evaders also can use shell companies to hide the identity of end users or the final destination of goods. For example, evaders can incorporate a front or shell company in a third country and arrange for citizens of that third country to manage it. This can make it seem as though the company buying the goods (the end user) is operating in a third country. FATF has stated that shell companies are one of the most frequently used methods to hide identities.

**3. Describe the four steps of the Know Your Customer (KYC) research model.**

_Correct Answer:_

The Know Your Customer (KYC) research model involves:

1. Assess: "What do we need to know?" Determine what information the firm already knows, what information is missing, and how to most effectively collect that information.

2. Explore: "Where can we find the answers?" Execute the plan created to collect the necessary information. This step includes expanding the firm's research toolkit and effectively using time and effort.

3. Organize: "How do we make customer information meaningful?" Organize and structure the information collected in a meaningful way according to the firm's risk based approach.

4. Present: "How do we present customer information in a manner to fulfill its purpose, i.e., aid in the detection of suspicious activity?" Present the information collected in a meaningful way according to the firm's risk-based approach.

**4. In general, what is the role of screening in an effective sanctions compliance program?**

_Correct Answer:_

Sanctions screening is one of the key controls of an effective sanctions compliance program. In simple terms, screening involves checking information obtained about a person, entity, goods, or services against sanctions lists that prohibit making funds or financial services available and/ or restrict or prohibit trade in certain goods or services. When screening generates an alert, the data is reviewed and assessed.

***
**5. What is a partial match?**

_Correct Answer:_

A partial match is a result generated by an automated screening tool. It means the entity being screened is similar enough to the sanctioned entity based on fuzzy logic and potentially other identifying factors, such as date of birth. Partial matches require further human intervention to determine whether the match is a target match (or true match), i.e., whether the name being screened is the same entity as the sanctioned target.

**6. Use an example to explain why it is important for a firm's automated screening tool (AST) to be correctly and appropriately "mapped" to the firm.**

_Correct Answer:_

The correct and appropriate mapping/ connecting of a firm's various systems and databases to the AST relates directly to operational effectiveness. Payment messages contain many fields of unique information. ASTs may require mapping from the message to the AST to ensure it uses the proper screening methods. For example, some fields only contain Bank Identification Codes (BIC); screening this field against the entirety of the OFAC list would generate numerous false positives. With proper mapping from this field to the AST, it would only screen this field against sanctioned BIC codes.

Conversely, if a field from SWIFT were incorrectly mapped, the result could be severe under-screening of the message.

Screening the freeform text in the "purpose of payment" field only against sanctioned BIC codes could result in many false negatives.

**7. What should sanctions compliance team members know about a firm's data, data flows, and data validation?**

_Correct Answer:_

Because IT and data are fundamental parts of ASTs, it is important for sanctions compliance teams to work with IT to properly understand how data works within the firm, where data is stored, what data is available, and the quality of the data. It is also important to understand how data is being extracted (i.e., taken from one system, transformed or modified, and loaded or ingested between systems).

Sometimes important data can be lost or modified through the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process from one system to another in ways that can result in a compliance breach.

**8. Generally, what is involved in a sanctions investigation?**

_Correct Answer:_

A sanctions investigation is the process of obtaining, evaluating, recording, and storing information about an individual or legal entity with whom one is conducting business, in response to an alert indicating a possible sanctions violation. Investigations often begin with simple checks before progressing to further investigation such as account review, customer outreach, and possible escalation to the compliance function.
