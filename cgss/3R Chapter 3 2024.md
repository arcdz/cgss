# CGSS Chapter 3 Exam With 100% Correct Answers 2024

***
**1. Describe customer due diligence (CDD) as part of risk management.**

_Correct Answer:_

3-1 Customer due diligence (CDD) is a set of internal controls that enable a financial institution to establish a customer's identity, predict with relative certainty the types of transactions in which the customer is likely to engage, and assess the extent to which the customer exposes the institution to a range of risks (i.e., money laundering and sanctions). Organizations need to know their customers through CDD to guard against fraud and comply with the requirements of relevant legislation and regulation. Effective CDD programs help to protect banks' reputations and the integrity of banking systems by reducing the likelihood of banks becoming a vehicle for or a victim of financial crime. As such, they constitute an essential part of sound risk management.

**2. Define sanctions due diligence (SDD).**

_Correct Answer:_

3-2 Similar to Know Your Customer (KYC) / customer due diligence (CDD), sanctions due diligence (SDD) is a process that focuses on the risks specific to sanctions, taking into account governance and risk assessment. SDD builds upon the KYC/CDD information an organization collects as part of its existing AML program. SDD is applied throughout the life cycle of a relationship (1) at the start of a relationship (i.e., onboarding), (2) when new products are introduced, (3) in response to trigger events during a relationship, such as a "match" generated by a screening tool, (4) during periodic reviews, and (5) when a relationship ends.

**3. What is the role of a sanctions compliance officer (SCO) within a sanctions compliance program?**

_Correct Answer:_

3-3 Within the second line of defense in the governance structure of a sanctions compliance program, the sanctions compliance officer (SCO) is responsible for ongoing monitoring for sanctions compliance. This monitoring includes sample testing and a review of exception reports to enable the escalation of identified noncompliance and other issues to senior management and, where appropriate, the board. The SCO is the contact point for all sanctions-related issues for internal and external authorities and is responsible for reporting suspicious transactions. To enable the successful oversight of the sanctions compliance program, the SCO must have sufficient independence from the business lines to prevent conflicts of interest and facilitate unbiased advice and counsel.

**4. What is the purpose of dual control, and why is it sometimes referred to as "four eyes"?**

_Correct Answer:_

3-4 Dual control is a principle whereby at least two employees are required in order to complete an internal control task—thus, "four eyes." The purpose of dual control is to protect against internal fraud and prevent internal control failure at a single point.

***
**5. When is enhanced due diligence (EDD) appropriate, and what does it do?**

_Correct Answer:_

3-5 Due to the targeted nature of sanctions and the risks of links to terrorist financing, it is important to have in place solid governance frameworks for business activities in or related to sanctioned countries and terrorist financing networks. Therefore, firms need to develop appropriate risk assessment tools with which to identify high-risk customers and high-risk products, and then subsequently undertake enhanced due diligence (EDD) to identify the direct and, more importantly, the indirect links to sanctioned entities and individuals.

***
**6. What are the three lines of defense within the governance structure of a sanctions compliance program?**

_Correct Answer:_

3-6 The three lines of defense within the governance structure of a sanctions compliance program are the business line (front line), sanctions compliance, and internal audit.

***
**7. What does FATF Recommendation 10 specify regarding Know Your Customer due diligence?**

_Correct Answer:_

3-7 Know Your Customer (KYC) is FATF's Recommendation 10. FATF recommends that institutions incorporate the following measures into their KYC programs:

- Identifying the customer and verifying the customer's identity using reliable independent source documents, data, or information
- Identifying the beneficial owners and taking reasonable measures to verify their identities
- Understanding and, as appropriate, obtaining information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship
- Conducting ongoing due diligence on the business relationship and scrutinizing transactions undertaken throughout the course of the relationship to ensure that the transactions being conducted are consistent with the institution's knowledge of the customer, their business, their risk profile, and, where necessary, the source of their funds

***
**8. What is the key information to collect about customers to help reduce a firm's sanctions compliance risk?**

_Correct Answer:_

3-8 Undertaking SDD at onboarding is critical to identify potential sanctions risks and to identify customers who might later become sanctions targets. Key information to collect about customers includes:

- The customer: Who is the customer? If it is a legal entity, who owns and controls it, and who are the beneficial owners and intermediate owners (i.e., those legal intermediary owners that are not natural persons), if appropriate? What assets do they hold, directly or indirectly?
- The nature of the business: What goods/products and services do they use? What activities do they engage in? Could the goods or services have a military purpose?
- The jurisdiction or geographical connections: In what jurisdictions do the parties operate? With which jurisdictions do they intend to interact (involving your institution as opposed to its overall operations)?

***
**9. Define beneficial owner.**

_Correct Answer:_

3-9 The term "beneficial owner" (also referred to as ultimate beneficial owner) has two different definitions depending on the context:

- The natural person who ultimately owns or controls the funds in an account through which a transaction is being conducted
- The natural person(s) who ultimately owns or controls a customer or who exercises effective control over a legal person or arrangement

***
**10. How does the OFAC 50% Rule prevent sanctions targets from creating complex corporate structures and spreading out their ownership holdings?**

_Correct Answer:_

3-10 The OFAC 50% Rule states that if a sanctions target owns 50% or more of another legal entity, the legal entity is also subject to the sanctions restrictions—even if it is not itself named as a sanctions target. The rule does not simply apply to the ownership of a single company; it also requires that beneficial ownership be based on the total, or aggregate, amount of shares that sanctions targets own across a corporate structure. This rule prevents sanctions targets from creating complex corporate structures and spreading their ownership across the holding structure so they don't hold more than 50% of any one corporate entity. Therefore, the sanctions target is unable to circumvent sanctions and maintain access to its assets held in various entities.

***
**11. How is the EU's European Best Practice Guidance different from OFAC in regard to sanctions due diligence and beneficial ownership?**

_Correct Answer:_

3-11 There are three significant differences between OFAC and the EU's European Best Practice Guidance concerning SDD and beneficial ownership:

1. The EU's rule applies when a sanctions target owns more than 50% of a legal entity.
2. The EU has not yet implemented the aggregate rule. 
3. The EU requires that assets be frozen when a sanctions target "controls" or exercises influence over an entity.

***
**12. Explain the common error of "pass-through sanctions risk".**

_Correct Answer:_

3-12 Pass-through sanctions risk is the incorrect assumption that the sanctions risks associated with a customer's affiliates or subsidiaries is simply a problem for the customer to assess and manage. Regulators in the United Kingdom and United States require all parties within a transaction chain to check for possible sanctions risks. It is important for financial institutions to ask for and review information about a customer's affiliates and subsidiaries.

***
**13. Describe the four steps of the Know Your Customer (KYC) research model.**

_Correct Answer:_

3-13 The Know Your Customer (KYC) research model involves:

1. Assess: "What do we need to know?" Determine what information the firm already knows, what information is missing, and how to most effectively collect that information.
2. Explore: "Where can we find the answers?" Execute the plan created to collect the necessary information. This step includes expanding the firm's research toolkit and effectively using time and effort.
3. Organize: "How do we make customer information meaningful?" Organize and structure the information collected in a meaningful way according to the firm's risk- based approach.
4. Present: "How do we present customer information in a manner to fulfill its purpose, i.e., aid in the detection of suspicious activity?" Present the information collected in a meaningful way according to the firm's risk-based approach.

***
**14. What information is included in a bill of exchange?**

_Correct Answer:_

3-14 A bill of exchange is a shipping document that shows the means by which exporters are paid for the goods that are to be shipped, including information such as the names of the exporter, importer, issuing bank, and the bank where the funds will be drawn.

***
**15. How is an end-user certificate used?**

_Correct Answer:_

3- 15 An end-user certificate is a shipping document used to certify that a buyer is the final recipient of the materials and is not planning to transfer the materials to another party. Arms, ammunition, and certain other sensitive merchandise require an end-user certificate or attestation that the goods will not be further sold or shipped. This certificate or attestation is subject to verification by regulatory authorities. If the purchaser's intent is to defraud, however, this certificate will include false information.

***
**16. Define bill of lading.**

_Correct Answer:_

3-16 A bill of lading is a required document that a carrier issues as a receipt of cargo. It includes the type and quantity of cargo, as well as the destination.

***
**17. What is correspondent banking, and why are the sanctions risks potentially higher and more difficult to identify when a financial institution offers correspondent banking to other firms?**

_Correct Answer:_

3-17 Correspondent banking is the provision of banking services by one bank (the correspondent bank) to another bank (the respondent bank). Large international banks typically act as correspondents for hundreds of other banks around the world. Respondent banks may be provided with a wide range of services, including cash management (e.g., interest- bearing accounts in a variety of currencies), international wire transfers of funds, check clearing services, payable- through accounts, and foreign exchange services. By their nature, correspondent banking relationships create a situation in which a financial institution carries out financial transactions on behalf of customers of another institution. This indirect relationship means that the correspondent bank provides services for individuals or entities for which it has neither verified the identities nor obtained any firsthand knowledge.
